final project reflection

This project create a platform where users could rate dishes, update or delete ratings and dishes. In this project, I learnt about understanding the intricacies of web development and how different technologies could work together. I also learnt about how to use github to keep track of my project.

While working on this project, I encountered many challenges, such as unfamiliarity with the overall framework and lack of understanding of the specific methods within the framework, and these difficulties prevented me from successfully continuing my project. Therefore, I had to keep looking for relevant documentation and resources, and try to solve the problems by myself. This continuous process of learning and correcting mistakes has given me more confidence in my learning ability and ability to complete tasks independently. This is what I like most about my own progress in this project.

Looking forward, the project could be improved by incorporating more features such as user authentication and implementing more robust security measures. Future updates could include a more extensive database, more detailed ratings and review system, and more interactive interfaces. As a programmer, this project has shown how my abilities can be applied to real-world applications. In the future, I hope to develop more applications that can help people make informed decisions or assist in making tasks more manageable.
